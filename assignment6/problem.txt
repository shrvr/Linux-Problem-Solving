Assignment-6

Write a C program, call it newBash, that takes a script
file as input and interprets it the same way as Bash. Your
program read each line then, assembles and executes each
command. Note that piping can be present. To make it
simple, you can assume that there are no control
structures, like if or loops.

Examples of a 4-line input script file:
• ls | wc -w
• date; echo I printed date
• ps -ef
• more file.tx | grep bigFoot

In particular,
 - you should only use Unix I/O system calls.
 - check how many commands in a line, separate them
 and fork the appropriate number of children.
 - a semi-column is equivalent to a new line in a script
 file
